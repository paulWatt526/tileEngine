# Project Template for Library Plugins (Lua)


## Overview

This is a template/stationary for those interested in packaging Lua code into a reusable [library plugin](http://docs.coronalabs.com/native/plugin/index.html#types-of-plugins). You can use these plugins in your own [Corona](https://coronalabs.com/products/corona-sdk/) projects or distribute them in the [Corona Store](https://store.coronalabs.com/plugins)


## New projects

### Creating your project

To create a new project, we have provided helper scripts that can do the necessary file renaming and string replacements for both Mac OS X and Windows.

#### Mac

Run the script [create_project.sh](create_project.sh) in Terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/this/repo/
./create_project.sh /path/to/new/project/folder wattageTileEngine
```

#### Windows

Run the script [create_project.bat](create_project.bat) in the command prompt:

```batch
cd \path\to\this\repo\
create_project.bat \path\to\new\project\folder wattageTileEngine
```

### Project Files

Your new project should contain the following files and folders:

* [bin/](bin/): Core binaries required by the build process.
+ [build.bat](build.bat): Compiles and packages the plugin for distribution using Windows.
+ [build.sh](build.sh): Compiles and packages the plugin for distribution using a Mac.
* [metadata.json](metadata.json): Contains publisher information, including contact and website data.
* [lua/](lua/)
	+ __Test Harness:__
		+ [build.settings](lua/build.settings)
		+ [config.lua](lua/config.lua)
		+ [main.lua](lua/main.lua)
	+ __Plugin:__
		+ [plugin/wattageTileEngine.lua](lua/plugin/wattageTileEngine.lua)
			- This is a stub/sample library implementation that implements saving a table to a file and loading it back via JSON.
		+ [plugin/wattageTileEngine/defaults.lua](lua/plugin/wattageTileEngine/defaults.lua)
			- This is a helper library for wattageTileEngine.

## Library Plugin Development

### Workflow

__NOTE:__ _You should use dailybuild 2015.2642 or higher when developing your plugins. If you are using a previous version, you will have to "flatten" the plugin file ( `plugin/wattageTileEngine.lua` => `plugin_wattageTileEngine.lua`) in order to load it in the Corona Simulator. You can still target versions earlier than 2015.2642; this is purely a convenience feature for plugin developers starting in 2015.2642._

For workflow convenience, the test harness and library plugin code are integrated to simplify shader effect development:

* The test harness is in the [lua/](lua/) folder, including the [lua/main.lua](lua/main.lua) file.
* The library plugin is in the subfolder of the test harness: [lua/plugin/wattageTileEngine.lua](lua/plugin/wattageTileEngine.lua).

That way, you can open the test harness in the Corona Simulator, modify your shader effects, and preview those changes immediately.

You can also open the test harness in [CoronaViewer](https://github.com/coronalabs/CoronaViewer) to preview those changes immediately on a device.

### Library Plugin File

The stub library plugin is something you should modify for your own purposes. The functionality implemented in the stub is explained in the [Doc Template for Library Docs](https://github.com/coronalabs/plugins-template-library-docs)

### Device Testing

Device testing is critical for several reasons:

* If your plugin uses shaders, there are subtle differences in the flavor of GLSL that runs on desktop vs mobile.
* Even though your code compiles on a desktop (Mac/Win), you should make sure it also compiles and runs on the device.


## Corona Store Submission

### Preparing for Submission

If you'd like to [submit a plugin](https://store.coronalabs.com/corona-store-application), there are a few more steps you need to take:

1. Update [metadata.json](metadata.json). 
	* This contains several strings in ALL CAPS that should be replaced with information specific to your plugin. 
	* While the helper script has already done a replacement of `wattageTileEngine` for you, there are still several strings that need to be updated.
	* Please see the section `Replacing strings in ALL CAPS` in the [Plugin Submission Guidelines](http://docs.coronalabs.com/daily/native/plugin/submission.html) for a complete list.
2. Device Testing
	* See [Device Testing](#device-testing) above.
	* You should make sure your code executes on iOS and Android devices. 
	* Verify that your code compiles on device
	* Understand potential performance issues on lower-end devices.
3. Documentation
	* Fork or clone [Doc Template for Library Docs](https://github.com/coronalabs/plugins-template-library-docs)
	* Follow the [Instructions](https://github.com/coronalabs/plugins-template-library-docs/blob/master/Instructions.markdown)
4. Sample Code
	* Post sample code online, e.g. github.

### Packaging Your Plugin

The packaging of your submission should follow a specific structure.

There is a convenience script that takes care of creating this structure (`build.sh` or `build.bat`). You can provide it with the daily build number corresponding to the minimum supported version of Corona (e.g. the first version of Corona you'd like the plugin to work with).

#### Example

For example, let's pretend we are submitting this repo's project by build our plugin. This converts your code into bytecode and prepares it for submission to the Corona Plugin Store. When this is complete, you will have a `plugin-<wattageTileEngine>.zip` file in your project directory, fit for uploading.

##### Mac

```bash
cd /path/to/this/repo/
./build.sh
```

##### Windows

```batch
cd /path/to/this/repo/
build.bat
```

### Submitting Your Plugin

Once your plugin is complete (including documentation and at least one sample), you can submit it to the Corona Store, using the [Corona Store Application](https://store.coronalabs.com/corona-store-application) page.

Someone from Corona will then get in contact with you to personally help you to put your compiled lua files onto our distribution servers. This is done through a shared BitBucket repository. A basic understanding of Mercurial (hg) is required, and your contact can help you through any questions.
